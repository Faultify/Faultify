    ///     Analyzer that searches for possible comparison operator mutations.
    ///     Mutations such as that a condition is made false, like '<' to '>'.
    ///     With conditional operators we only have to find one way to invalidate the condition
    ///     as opposed to the arithmetic operators where each operator has to be replaced.
    ///     This mutator mutates two kinds of instructions 'branch instructions' and 'comparison' institutions.
    ///     The branch instruction like (beq, bgt, blt) are available in various permutations, but in all circumstances it is
    ///     essentially a goto statement.
    ///     Most branch instructions are conditional and based on a comparative expression or a Boolean condition.
    ///     Compare instructions like (ceq, cgt, clt) perform a comparison on the top two values of the evaluation stack.
    ///     The two values are replaced on the evaluation stack with the result of the comparison, which is either true or
    ///     false.
    ///     The comparison should be between related types.
    ///     As a convenience, branch and compare instructions are combinable.
    ///     The combined instruction compares the top two values of the evaluation stack and branches on the result.
    ///     These are called comparative branching instructions.
    ///     Instead of requiring two instructions to perform the test, only one is needed.
    ///     The '<=' Boolean operator in the source code translates to the 'bgt' instruction in the IL (meaning branch on greater).
    /// 
    ///     You might have expected '<=' to translate to 'ble' (branch on less than or equal),
    ///     but it turns out that the compiler will usually optimize control flow by translating a Boolean operator into its IL complement branching instruction.
    ///     Hense it can be the case that on different computers IL code for comparison can be a bit different.
